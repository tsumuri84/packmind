# Create Skill Procedure

Write a new skill directory locally in an agent skills directory.

## Write Path Selection

Skills are stored in agent-specific directories:
- `.claude/skills/` (agent: claude)
- `.cursor/skills/` (agent: cursor)
- `.github/skills/` (agent: copilot)

**Selection logic**: check which directories exist at the project root. Pick the first one found in priority order:
1. `.claude/skills/`
2. `.cursor/skills/`
3. `.github/skills/`

If none exist, create `.claude/skills/` as the default.

**Write path**: `<agent-skills-dir>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

## Slug Derivation

Derive the skill name from the title: lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens, remove special characters.

**Example**: "PDF Processing" → `pdf-processing`

**Naming rules**:
- 1-64 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Must not start or end with a hyphen
- Must not contain consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Directory name MUST match the `name` field in SKILL.md frontmatter

## Directory Structure

```
<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md          # Required
├── references/       # Optional — detailed docs, specs, lookup tables
├── scripts/          # Optional — executable code agents can run
└── assets/           # Optional — templates, images, data files
```

**When to use each resource type:**
- **scripts/**: Executable code for tasks requiring deterministic reliability or repeatedly rewritten code (e.g. `scripts/rotate_pdf.py`). Token-efficient — may be executed without loading into context.
- **references/**: Documentation loaded into context as needed (schemas, API docs, domain knowledge). Keeps SKILL.md lean — avoid duplicating content between SKILL.md and references.
- **assets/**: Files used in output (templates, images, boilerplate) — not loaded into context, copied or modified by Claude during execution.

## SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: 'What the skill does and when to use it. Third-person form. Include trigger keywords for auto-load.'
---

# Skill Title

Body content with instructions, examples, and edge cases.
```

### Critical Format Constraints

- **Directory name must match `name` field** — e.g. directory `pdf-processing/` requires `name: pdf-processing`
- **`name`**: 1-64 chars, lowercase + hyphens only, no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens
- **`description`**: 1-800 chars (Packmind cap, tighter than the 1024 spec maximum), include specific keywords that help agents identify when to activate
- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** — use `references/` for detailed content overflow
- **Both the directory path and the `SKILL.md` path** are valid references to a skill (they resolve to the same directory)

### Description Writing Guidelines

The description determines when the skill auto-loads. Write it to:
- **Stay within 800 characters.** This is a Packmind cap (the upstream spec allows 1024). The description is always loaded into agent context, so keep it lean. If you need more room to explain the skill, move detail into the SKILL.md body or a `references/` file.
- Describe what the skill does in **third-person form** (e.g. "This skill should be used when..." not "Use this skill when...")
- Include trigger phrases the user might say (e.g. "extract text from PDF", "fill PDF forms")
- Mention relevant keywords for discoverability

**Good**: `'Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill PDF forms, and merge multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.'`

**Poor**: `'Helps with PDFs.'`

### Writing Style

- Use **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person (e.g. "To accomplish X, do Y" not "You should do X")
- Write for another Claude instance — focus on non-obvious procedural knowledge, not general capabilities
- **File placement rule**: create files directly in their target subdirectory (`references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`), never at skill root then move

### Body Content Guidelines

- Provide step-by-step instructions for the main workflow
- Include examples of inputs and outputs
- Document common edge cases
- **Progressive disclosure**: metadata (~100 words, always in context) → SKILL.md body (<5k words, loaded on trigger) → bundled resources (loaded as needed). Structure content accordingly.
- **No duplication**: information should live in either SKILL.md or references, not both. Keep SKILL.md lean with essential workflow guidance; move detailed schemas, specs, and examples to `references/`.
- **Large references**: if reference files exceed ~10k words, include grep search patterns in SKILL.md so Claude can locate relevant sections without loading the entire file
